# Call-Code-Employee-Management-System

# About this project:

This is my 12th project. This is the call-code-employee-management-system, an CLI application that store companies' databases about the employee's info about their 
roles, their departments, their individual id and salaries.The managers have access to the employee's info and add new roles.   Running files schema and seeds.ql using SQL workbench, it is a powerful tool to connects the database to the server. First, you have to install the package for mysql workbench. I use either workbench installer or the download on the website. second, you have to create a connection for with username and Mysql workbench is to create a datbase for company_db in both the terminal and mysql workbench to work. It is an organized tool to track the companies down on what they doing.
